# BandMate Chromatic Tuner
This is a free tuner that is used by thousands of band students.  I coded the web app primarily with JavaScript.  The cool thing about it that makes it unique is that a student can pick what instrument they are using, and they will see the sheet music notation of the note that they are playing in their own instrument's key.  This is not a standard instrument tuner feature, which is why this is used so widely in school band rooms.
